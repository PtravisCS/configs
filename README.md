# Config Files

This repo contains scripts for re-installing my normal setup from scratch.
It also includes config files for some of the more complicated configurations I use.

To install from scratch run:

```PowerShell
.\first_time_setup.ps1
```

To update existing configs run:

```PowerShell
python3 install.py
```
